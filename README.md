# SELF-BALANCING-BEAM
For the selection of the appropriate microcontroller we considered as the best for our use the Arduino UNO which is a microcontroller that needs basic programming knowledge and is considered one of the easiest to use. As for the language we used is C ++ which is very basic in the field of programming and it is also the language that knows how to read our ARDUINO. As for the motors, we used the servomotor because it uses sharpness and gives us the desired result in specific degrees. As sensors we used four lighting fixtures providing adequate lighting continuously with the result that when the light resistor has no light and the values ​​fall then it will instruct the servomotor to change the angle depending on which light resistor is activated. We also chose the photoresistors because they are easier to connect and provide relatively good accuracy for project implementation.
